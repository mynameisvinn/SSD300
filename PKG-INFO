        ### Installation
        There are two ways to install this package:
        
        1. Docker - build the docker image and run the docker container (`docker/build.sh` and `docker/run.sh`)
        
        With Docker installed in the environment:
        ```
        cd docker
        ./build.sh && ./run.sh
        ```
        
        2. Pip install - use a python virtual environment and pip install
        
        With python3.7, venv, and pip installed in the environment
        ```
        python -m venv ssd300
        source ssd300/bin/activate
        pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pip install -e ssd300
        
        # To deactivate virtual environment
        deactivate
        ```
        
        ### Train an ssd300 model
        
        Use the templates in `examples` for running the `train_ssd.py` python script.
        
        Here are the arguments to use for a baseline training run:
        
        exp=experiment_name
        batch_size=32  # Only needs to change if architecture is very big.
        
        ### Distributing
        
        To make a tarball with working version info, run:
        
        ```bash
        python setup.py sdist
        ```
        
        Then collect the tarball from `dist/`.
